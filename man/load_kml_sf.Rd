\title{Convert KML to Simple Features (sf) Object with Preserved Attributes}
\usage{
load_kml_sf(kml_path, ..., id_col = "Name", details_col = "Description")
}
\arguments{
\item{kml_path}{A character string specifying the path to the KML file. The path can be a local file or a URL, and zipped files are supported.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{sf::read_sf()} for reading the KML file.}

\item{id_col}{A character string indicating the column in the KML file that contains feature identifiers (default is "Name").}

\item{details_col}{A character string specifying the column that contains descriptive data to be parsed (default is "Description").}
}
\value{
An \code{sf} object containing the geometry and parsed attributes extracted from the KML file.
}
\description{
This function reads a KML file and processes the specified columns to extract
feature identifiers and descriptive attributes, returning an \code{sf} object
that retains the geometry and parsed attribute data.
}
\details{
The function parses the \code{details_col} to extract key-value pairs in the format "label: value",
ensuring that all features have a consistent structure. Any missing values are handled appropriately.
